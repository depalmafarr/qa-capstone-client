# Mixer Q&A Client dev process

Started by making sure the app is connected to the api so that users can create accounts and ask quesitons in a user friendly way. When I hit issues I used research and other classmates to get through building the front end. There are many more styling choices that must be made in the future for this site.


## Deployed sites

Front end (https://depalmafarr.github.io/qa-capstone-client/#/).
Back end (https://shrouded-ocean-15397.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting Started

Can be made and grunt served onto your server from the link to the project here (https://github.com/depalmafarr/qa-capstone-client)

### Future fixes/issues

- Question/answer voting +1 -1
- Specific sections you can ask and answer in
- Styling changes (so many)
